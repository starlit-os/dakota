# CI Pipeline Operations

Load when debugging CI failures, understanding the build pipeline, or working with the remote CAS cache.

## When NOT to Use

- Diagnosing an individual element build failure → `debugging.md`
- Writing or modifying `.bst` element files → `buildstream.md`
- Understanding what packages flow into the OCI image → `oci-layers.md`

## Quick Reference

| What | Value |
|---|---|
| Workflow file | `.github/workflows/build.yml` |
| Runner | `ubuntu-24.04` (standard GitHub-hosted) |
| Build target | `oci/bluefin.bst` |
| Build timeout | 330 min (job: 360 min) |
| Remote cache server | `cache.projectbluefin.io:11002` |
| Cache auth | mTLS — `CASD_CLIENT_CERT` (repo variable) + `CASD_CLIENT_KEY` (secret) |
| Published image | `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota:{testing,latest,stable}` and `:$SHA` |
| Build logs artifact | `buildstream-logs-x86_64-<variant>` (7-day retention) |
| Trigger (validate) | `pull_request` — `bst show --deps all`, no CAS |
| Trigger (build) | `merge_group`, `workflow_dispatch` (no daily schedule) |
**Nightly schedule rationale** — no longer applicable; schedule trigger was removed in favour of continuous builds on every merge.

**Merge queue path:** `build` fires on `merge_group` — full OCI build, real CI gate before merge. On success, `publish.yml` immediately promotes the new image to `:testing`.

## Workflow Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/build.yml` | BST build + push artifacts to remote CAS. Fires on `merge_group` and `workflow_dispatch` only (no schedule). Does NOT push to GHCR directly. |
| `.github/workflows/publish.yml` | 3-stage pipeline: setup → publish → promote. Pulls artifact from CAS, exports OCI, pushes `:$sha`, signs, attests, then immediately promotes to `:testing` on every successful merge. No e2e gate — that lives only in the weekly promotion. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Called from `weekly-testing-promotion.yml` after a successful promotion. Creates GitHub Release with card image, SBOM diff, and package changelog. Also available as `workflow_dispatch` for out-of-band cuts. |
| `.github/workflows/weekly-testing-promotion.yml` | Weekly Tuesday promotion (06:00 UTC): 7-day floor check → verify `:testing` digests → cosign verify → e2e → promote to `:latest`+`:stable` → fast-forward branches → call `release.yml`. Has `environment: production` gate requiring human approval. |
| `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` | Smoke test via projectbluefin/testsuite. Fires on PR; `should-run` job skips the test when no image-affecting paths changed. |

## Trigger Behavior

| Behavior | pull_request | merge_group | workflow_dispatch |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validate` job | Yes | No | No |
| `e2e` job | Yes (change-detected) | No | Yes |
| `build` job | No | Yes | Yes |
| Push to GHCR? | No | Via publish.yml | Via publish.yml |

**PR path:** `validate` + `e2e` (change-detected) — zero remote execution. ~15 min cached, ~30 min cold.

**e2e change detection:** `e2e` uses a `should-run` job that diffs the PR branch against its base. It runs when `elements/`, `files/`, `patches/`, `Justfile`, or `project.conf` change; otherwise the `e2e` job is skipped. Skipped satisfies the required status check.

**Merge queue path:** `build` fires on `merge_group` — full OCI build, real CI gate before merge.

## Remote Cache Architecture

`cache.projectbluefin.io:11002` handles all five BST remote services: artifact cache, source cache, CAS storage, remote execution, and action cache. All use the same endpoint with mTLS auth.

### mTLS Authentication

| Variable | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `CASD_CLIENT_CERT` | Repository **variable** | PEM-encoded client certificate (public) |
| `CASD_CLIENT_KEY` | Repository **secret** | PEM-encoded private key |

**Push is conditional:** Remote cache section is only added to `buildstream-ci.conf` if **both** are set. Without credentials, BST builds from source using local disk cache only — slower but functional. This is normal for external contributors' forks.

## ⚠️ Pre-Commit BST Syntax Gate

For any change to `project.conf`, `*.bst` elements, or `Justfile`:

```bash
just bst show oci/bluefin.bst
```

Must exit clean before `git commit`. Catches invalid option names, types, and element references. Takes 5 seconds. Skipping wastes a 90-second CI build slot.

## ⚠️ Branch Base Rule

Always branch from `upstream/main`, never from local `main`:

```bash
git checkout upstream/main -b feature/my-change
git diff upstream/main...HEAD --stat   # verify before pushing
```

**Recovery when a branch is already dirty:**
```bash
git rebase --onto upstream/main <last-unwanted-commit-sha> <branch-name>
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

## Debugging CI Failures

### Where to Find Logs

| Log | Location |
|---|---|
| Build log | `buildstream-logs` artifact → `logs/` |
| Config generation | "Generate BuildStream CI config" step in workflow |
| Workflow log | GitHub Actions UI → step output |

### Common Failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Build OOM or hangs | Memory pressure with 4 builders | Check element build resource usage |
| "No space left on device" | BST cache fills runner disk | Check if any element generates large buildtrees |
| `bootc container lint` fails | Image structure issues | Check OCI assembly, `/usr/etc` merge |
| Build succeeds locally, fails in CI | Different cached versions | Compare `bst show` output; check remote CAS |
| GHCR push fails | Token permissions | Check `packages: write` permission |
| Remote cache not used | Cert/key not configured | Check repo Variables and Secrets |

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Check config step output** — confirms whether `artifacts:` / `source-caches:` sections are present
2. **Search build log** — look for `[FAILURE]` lines; `on-error: continue` collects all failures
3. **Check if remote cache was hit** — look for `[get artifact]` lines showing `cache.projectbluefin.io:11002`
4. **Reproduce locally** — `just bst build oci/bluefin.bst` uses the same bst2 container

## Generated Files (Pre-Commit Required)

Some files are generated locally and committed — they cannot be regenerated in CI because generation requires `bst artifact list-contents`, which only reads the **local** BST artifact cache (not remote execution cache).

| File | Generator | When to Regenerate |
|---|---|---|
| `files/filemap.json` | `python3 scripts/gen-filemap.py` | After any element change affecting file layout |
| `files/fakecap-manifest.tsv` | `python3 scripts/gen-filemap.py` | Same |

```bash
# Regenerate
rm files/filemap.json files/fakecap-manifest.tsv
python3 scripts/gen-filemap.py
git add files/filemap.json files/fakecap-manifest.tsv
git commit -m "chore: regenerate chunkah filemap and fakecap manifest"
```

Treat these like `Cargo.lock` — commit the updates with your element changes.

## Bot PR CI — GITHUB_TOKEN Suppression

PRs created by a workflow using `GITHUB_TOKEN` do NOT fire `pull_request` events — GitHub suppresses workflow triggers from its own bot token to prevent recursive loops.

**Fix:** Use a GitHub App token (mergeraptor) for `gh pr create` in `track-bst-sources.yml`.

## Ruleset

Ruleset: `main-review-required-with-renovate-bypass`

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Required reviews | 1 approving review |
| Required status checks | `validate` + `e2e` |
| Merge queue | ALLGREEN, max_entries_to_build=1, check_response_timeout=120 min |
| Bypass actors | OrganizationAdmin, Renovate, mergeraptor |

**e2e change detection:** `e2e` only tests PRs touching `elements/`, `files/`, `patches/`, `Justfile`, or `project.conf`. For all other paths (e.g. workflow pin bumps) the `e2e` job is skipped, which satisfies the required check. The `should-run` job uses `git diff` against the PR base — no `paths:` filter on the trigger.

**Critical:** Required status checks must only include checks that fire on `pull_request`. A check that only fires on `merge_group` will permanently block the "Add to merge queue" button.

## Session Bootstrap Rule

At the start of every dakota session, check GNOME OS upstream status:

```bash
gh pr list --repo gnome/gnome-build-meta --state open --limit 10
gh run list --repo projectbluefin/dakota --limit 5
```

## Cross-References

| Skill | When |
|---|---|
| `oci-layers.md` | Understanding what the build produces |
| `debugging.md` | Diagnosing individual element build failures |
| `buildstream.md` | Writing or modifying `.bst` elements |
| `update-refs.md` | Understanding the source tracking workflow |

## Lessons Learned

### crun 1.21 (resolute) breaks just sbom on GHA — use --runtime runc (2026-06-08)

`update-podman: true` in `setup-runner` installs crun 1.21 from Ubuntu 26.04
(resolute). This version has two new failure modes that break `just sbom` on
GHA runners:

1. **seccomp BPF linkat EPERM** — crun caches compiled seccomp BPF programs
   via `linkat()`. The GHA runner kernel's `fs.protected_hardlinks` or user-
   namespace restrictions block the hard-link from `.cache/seccomp/` to the
   container bundle path:
   ```
   crun: linkat `.cache/seccomp/<hash>` to `<container-id>/seccomp.bpf`: Permission denied
   ```

2. **systemd probe EACCES** — crun probes systemd presence and caches the result
   in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/crun/.cache/systemd-missing-properties`. On GHA the
   runtime dir is either uninitialised or was created by root in a prior privileged
   step, causing user 1001 to get EACCES:
   ```
   crun: opendir `/run/user/1001/crun/.cache/systemd-missing-properties`: Permission denied
   ```

**Fix:** add `--runtime runc` to both `podman run` calls in `just sbom`. runc is
always available on ubuntu-24.04 GHA runners (Docker installs it). runc has
neither the seccomp BPF caching nor the systemd probing.

**Wrong partial fixes (both insufficient alone):**
- Dropping `--privileged` (#745) — doesn't prevent either error
- Adding `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` (#747) — fixes error 1 but not error 2

**Do not** add `seccomp=unconfined` as a workaround; use `--runtime runc` instead.
`bst show` and `buildstream-sbom` are read-only BST operations; runc is fully
sufficient.

```justfile
# ✅ correct
podman run --rm --network=host --runtime runc ...

# ❌ wrong — triggers crun 1.21 failure modes
podman run --rm --network=host ...
podman run --rm --network=host --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ...
```

### Continuous :testing model — every merge ships immediately (2026-06-07)

The pipeline was redesigned so every PR merge produces a new `:testing` image
without any e2e gate in the publish path. The schedule trigger was removed from
`build.yml`; builds now only fire on `merge_group` and `workflow_dispatch`.

**New flow:**
```
PR merge_group → build.yml → publish.yml → :$sha → :testing  (no e2e)
                                                           │
                     weekly-testing-promotion.yml ─────────┘
                     (e2e gate here, then :stable)
```

**Implication:** `:testing` may briefly be broken if a PR introduces a regression.
The e2e gate at the weekly promotion prevents regressions from reaching `:stable`.

**If :testing breaks:** look at the last few merge SHAs and bisect with
`gh run list --workflow "Publish Bluefin dakota" --limit 10`.

**TOCTOU guard interaction:** the weekly promotion's lock-sha step uses a GitHub
compare API ancestor check rather than exact equality. With continuous builds,
main will often be 1–2 commits ahead of `:testing` by Tuesday 06:00 UTC. An
exact-equality check would cause every promotion to fail. The ancestor check
allows promotion as long as `:testing` is a valid ancestor of main (i.e.,
histories have not diverged):

```bash
COMPARE=$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/compare/${SOURCE_SHA}...${CURRENT_SHA}" --jq '.status')
# "ahead" = main advanced past :testing = normal and fine
# anything else = diverged = abort
```

### publish.yml startup_failure = :testing is stale (2026-06-04)

`startup_failure` on `publish.yml` nightly runs means the BST artifact or
CAS cache lookup failed before the job even started. When this happens on two
or more consecutive nights, `:testing` stops being updated. Symptoms visible
downstream: every dep-update PR shows "SSH never became ready" in e2e because
the QEMU VM tries to boot the stale image. Fix: investigate `publish.yml`
startup_failure first — check repo Secrets/Variables for `CASD_CLIENT_CERT`
and `CASD_CLIENT_KEY` expiry, and confirm the CAS server is reachable.

**Also check if the workflow is disabled.** A `disabled_manually` workflow
silently produces `startup_failure` with zero job output — `jobs: []`.
Check with:

```bash
gh api repos/projectbluefin/dakota/actions/workflows \
  --jq '.workflows[] | "\(.id) \(.state) \(.name)"'
```

Re-enable with:

```bash
gh api repos/projectbluefin/dakota/actions/workflows/<id>/enable --method PUT
```

**Two confirmed causes of `startup_failure` with `jobs: []` (2026-06-04):**

1. **Invalid top-level `permissions:` key** — `artifact-metadata: write` is NOT a
   valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission scope. GitHub rejects the workflow at parse time
   before creating any jobs. `actionlint` does not catch this. Remove it.
   Valid scopes: `actions`, `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `discussions`,
   `environments`, `id-token`, `issues`, `packages`, `pages`, `pull-requests`,
   `repository-projects`, `security-events`, `statuses`, `attestations`.

2. **Job-level `permissions:` on a reusable workflow call job** — adding a
   `permissions:` block to a job that uses `uses:` (external reusable workflow)
   can cause GitHub to fail the entire workflow at startup. The working pattern
   (used by local `e2e.yml`) is to call the reusable workflow WITHOUT job-level
   permissions; it inherits from the top-level `permissions:` block instead.

**After fixing startup_failure, publish may still fail if no BST artifact is in
CAS for the current main SHA.** This happens when `build.yml` has only run on
branches (not main). Fix: dispatch `build.yml` on main first, wait for it to
complete (~5–6 hours), then dispatch `publish.yml`.

```bash
gh workflow run build.yml --repo projectbluefin/dakota --ref main
# wait for completion, then:
gh workflow run publish.yml --repo projectbluefin/dakota
```

### Dep updates on testing not reaching main (2026-06-04)

When dep-update PRs are merged directly to `testing`, `publish.yml` (which
builds from `main`) never sees them. Before dispatching a build or promotion,
check the gap:

```bash
git log --oneline upstream/main..upstream/testing -- elements/ files/ patches/
```

If commits exist, land them via a PR to `main`:

```bash
git checkout upstream/main -b fix/land-testing-deps
# Apply only element/files/patches diff — avoid docs/CI conflicts:
git diff upstream/main..upstream/testing -- elements/ files/ patches/ \
  > /tmp/testing-deps.patch
git apply --index /tmp/testing-deps.patch
git commit -m "chore(deps): land testing dep updates into main"
git push upstream fix/land-testing-deps
gh pr create --repo projectbluefin/dakota --base main --head fix/land-testing-deps ...
```

Do **not** cherry-pick the squash commits directly — they bundle docs/CI
changes that have already diverged between `testing` and `main`, producing
unresolvable conflicts in `AGENTS.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, and `docs/skills/`.

### Same e2e failure on all PRs = infrastructure, not code (2026-06-04)

If `e2e / GNOME 50 — smoke` fails with identical output across 4+ unrelated
PRs simultaneously, it is always an infrastructure issue — never a per-PR
code bug. The test suite tests `:testing` not the PR branch. Skip individual
PR debugging and go straight to:

```bash
gh run list --repo projectbluefin/dakota --workflow publish.yml --limit 10 \
  --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt
```

If the last successful publish run is >24 hours old, `:testing` is stale.
Check projectbluefin/testsuite for open issues before filing a new one.

### Remote CAS down = build dies immediately at element loading (2026-06-07)

When `cache.projectbluefin.io:11002` is unreachable, buildbox-casd exits after
6 connection retries (~18 seconds). BST reports this as a cryptic inner failure:

```
BUG: Message handling out of sync, unable to retrieve failure message for element plugins/buildstream-plugins-community.bst
FAILURE Loading elements
error: recipe `bst` failed with exit code 255
```

The real root cause is in the CASD log artifact:

```
[ERROR] Retry limit (5) exceeded for "GetCapabilities()"
[ERROR] 14: Failed to connect to remote host: Connection refused
```

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --repo projectbluefin/dakota \
  --name buildstream-logs-x86_64-default -D /tmp/bst-logs
cat /tmp/bst-logs/_casd/*.log | grep -E "connect|refused|ERROR" | tail -10
```

**Fix:** The remote CAS is infrastructure — it needs to be restarted on the server.
If the cache is truly down, the build cannot proceed (without the `cache.storage-service`,
BST has no local artifact store and cold-rebuilds everything which times out).
Re-trigger the build once the cache is back up:

```bash
gh workflow run "Build Bluefin dakota" --repo projectbluefin/dakota --ref main
```

**Ghost-local workaround:** Does not apply — ghost's userconfig has no remote CAS
configured, so ghost builds are unaffected by cache outages.

### Ghost-specific build fixes belong in userconfig, NOT elements (2026-06-07)

If a BST element fails to build on ghost but works in CI (remote execution), the
fix must go in ghost's local config — **never in the element itself**. Putting it
in the element invalidates the remote CAS artifact (cache-bust), forcing CI to
rebuild an element it was already handling correctly.

**Real example (2026-06-07):** Adding `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO: "thin"` to
`uutils-coreutils.bst` to fix a SIGABRT on ghost caused a 626-element cold rebuild
in CI. The build ran for 5h31m and timed out without completing (330-minute limit).

**Wrong:** `elements/bluefin/foo.bst` + `environment: CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO: "thin"`
**Right:** ghost `~/.config/buildstream/userconfig.yaml` project/element environment override

Ghost-specific environment overrides can go in userconfig under:
```yaml
projects:
  dakota:
    elements:
      bluefin/uutils-coreutils.bst:
        environment:
          CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO: "thin"
```

### Diagnosing a build timeout (330-minute limit) (2026-06-07)

A build that hits the 330-minute GitHub Actions timeout shows:
```
The action 'Build OCI image with BuildStream' has timed out after 330 minutes.
```

No element "failed" — the build was still running. Download the logs to find what
was active at timeout:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --repo projectbluefin/dakota \
  --name buildstream-logs-x86_64-default -D /tmp/bst-logs

# Find elements that were waiting for remote execution when the timeout hit:
grep -rl "Waiting for the remote build to complete" /tmp/bst-logs/ | while read f; do
  tail -1 "$f" | grep -q "Waiting" && echo "$f"
done

# Find the latest-timestamped log files (actively building at timeout):
find /tmp/bst-logs -name "*.log" | grep -oP '\d{8}-\d{6}' | sort | tail -10
```

**Root causes of timeouts:**

| Cause | Signal | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Element change invalidated CAS artifact | Many elements building from scratch (600+), cold build of all dependents | Revert the element change; put machine-local workarounds in userconfig |
| CAS server slow / degraded | Elements stuck "Waiting for the remote build to complete" for hours | Check CAS health; re-trigger after recovery |
| Single very slow element (e.g. webkitgtk) is a bottleneck | One element dominates build time | Normal; just needs a warm cache hit |

**After fixing the root cause**, the re-triggered build will use the existing CAS
artifacts for all elements whose cache keys are unchanged — typically a warm build
completes in under 90 minutes.

### Promotion pipeline hardening — bonedigger and release race (2026-06-07)

**bonedigger "workflow file issue":** The lifecycle caller (`bonedigger.yml`) was
pinned to a common SHA that pre-dated `lifecycle.yml` existing in that repo. Also,
the `brand_emoji` input is not declared by the reusable workflow — passing an
undeclared input causes a GitHub workflow validation failure. Fix: update the SHA
pin to a commit where the file exists and remove undeclared inputs.

```bash
# Find commits that contain the target workflow file
gh api "repos/projectbluefin/common/commits?path=.github/workflows/lifecycle.yml&per_page=3" \
  --jq '.[].sha'
```

**release.yml must not re-discover the publish run independently:** If `release.yml`
queries `gh run list --limit 1` after the promotion pipeline completes, a concurrent
publish run for a new SHA can land first and be picked up instead. Always pass the
promoted `source_sha` and `promoted_digest` as `workflow_call` inputs from the
promotion pipeline so `release.yml` filters by exact headSha.

**Invalid OCI digest fallback:** Never synthesize an OCI digest from a git SHA
(`sha256:${git_sha}`). If `skopeo inspect` fails, fail the job — a release with
a fake digest has wrong verification commands in the release notes.

**`cert-identity-regexp` must be fully anchored:** Cosign uses `MatchString` semantics,
so a regexp without a trailing `$` matches any URL with that prefix. Always anchor:
```
^https://github\.com/projectbluefin/dakota/\.github/workflows/publish\.yml@refs/heads/(main|gh-readonly-queue/main/.+)$
```

**SBOM artifact expiry fallback:** Build artifacts expire after 30 days. For
`workflow_dispatch` out-of-band cuts, add a Syft fallback:
```yaml
- name: Download SBOM
  id: sbom_artifact
  continue-on-error: true
  uses: actions/download-artifact@...
- name: Install Syft (fallback)
  if: steps.sbom_artifact.outcome == 'failure'
  id: syft
  uses: anchore/sbom-action/download-syft@<SHA> # v0
  with:
    syft-version: v1.44.0
- name: Generate SBOM with Syft (fallback)
  if: steps.sbom_artifact.outcome == 'failure'
  env:
    SYFT_CMD: ${{ steps.syft.outputs.cmd }}
  run: "${SYFT_CMD}" "ghcr.io/.../dakota@${DIGEST}" -o spdx-json=sbom-current/dakota.spdx.json
```
Use `anchore/sbom-action/download-syft` (SHA-pinned) instead of `curl .../main/install.sh | sh`.
The `@main` install script is a mutable supply-chain input even when the version flag is pinned.

### release.yml publish run search must include merge-queue branches (2026-06-07)

`gh run list --branch main` only returns runs whose triggering branch was exactly
`main`. Publish runs triggered by `workflow_run` from `gh-readonly-queue/main/**`
(i.e., merge queue builds) are associated with the queue branch, not `main`, in
the GitHub API. If the promoted `:stable` SHA came from a merge-queue run, the
`--branch main` filter silently misses it and `release.yml` exits with "no
successful publish run found."

**Fix:** Drop the `--branch filter and filter by `headBranch` in jq instead:
```bash
gh run list \
  --workflow "Publish Bluefin dakota" \
  --status success \
  --limit 100 \
  --json headSha,headBranch,createdAt,databaseId \
  | jq -r --arg sha "$SHA" '
      map(select(
        .headSha == $sha and
        (.headBranch == "main" or (.headBranch | test("^gh-readonly-queue/main/")))
      )) | .[0] // empty'
```

### workflow_dispatch on publish.yml can promote non-main refs to :testing (2026-06-07)

`publish.yml` has no branch guard on the `promote` job. A manual dispatch from a
non-main branch flows through e2e and promotes to `:testing`, fast-forwarding the
`testing` branch to an unmerged commit.

**Fix:** Add a branch guard to the `promote` job. Since `e2e-gate` no longer
exists (continuous build model), the guard goes directly on `promote`:
```yaml
promote:
  needs: [setup, publish]
  if: >-
    needs.publish.result == 'success' &&
    (github.event_name == 'workflow_run' || github.ref_name == 'main')
```
`workflow_run` events are always safe (they trigger from completed `main`/merge-queue
builds per the trigger filter in `publish.yml`). Only manual dispatches need the
`github.ref_name == 'main'` guard.

### release.yml manual dispatch TOCTOU (2026-06-07)

In `workflow_dispatch` mode with no `source_sha`, the original code resolved SHA
and digest in two separate `skopeo inspect` calls. If `:stable` moved between
them, the release would pair a wrong SHA with a wrong digest.

**Fix:** One `skopeo inspect --format '{{index .Labels "org.opencontainers.image.revision"}} {{.Digest}}'`
call extracts both values atomically. Write the digest to `$GITHUB_ENV` and read
it in the next step — no second skopeo call.

```bash
INSPECT=$(skopeo inspect --format \
  '{{index .Labels "org.opencontainers.image.revision"}} {{.Digest}}' \
  docker://ghcr.io/.../dakota:stable)
SHA=$(echo "${INSPECT}" | awk '{print $1}')
STABLE_DIGEST=$(echo "${INSPECT}" | awk '{print $2}')
echo "STABLE_DIGEST=${STABLE_DIGEST}" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
```


Full pipeline to promote `testing` → `stable` manually:

```bash
# 1. Check for testing-only element commits not yet in main
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline upstream/main..upstream/testing -- elements/ files/ patches/
# If any: land them via PR (see "Dep updates on testing not reaching main" above)

# 2. Ensure publish.yml is enabled
gh api repos/projectbluefin/dakota/actions/workflows \
  --jq '.workflows[] | select(.name | contains("Publish")) | "\(.id) \(.state)"'

# 3. Dispatch publish.yml to build :testing from current main
gh workflow run publish.yml --repo projectbluefin/dakota

# 4. Once publish completes, dispatch promotion (pauses for production environment approval)
gh workflow run weekly-testing-promotion.yml --repo projectbluefin/dakota
```

Step 4 requires approval at: https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota/deployments

The GitHub release (notes + card + SBOM) is created automatically by
`release.yml` after every successful `publish.yml` run — no manual step needed.

### check-diff skip silently skips missing variant :stable tags (2026-06-08)

`check-diff` compares `dakota:testing` vs `dakota:latest` only. If they match,
`has_diff=false` and the entire `promote` matrix is skipped — including the
nvidia variant. This means if `dakota-nvidia:stable` was never created (e.g.,
nvidia `:testing` didn't exist during the first promotion that set `:latest`),
it will silently never get set on subsequent runs where the default image hasn't
changed.

**How it breaks:**

1. First promotion: NVIDIA `:testing` not found → `has_nvidia=false` → nvidia skipped
2. Next promotion: NVIDIA `:testing` now exists, but `dakota:testing == dakota:latest`
   → `has_diff=false` → entire promote job skipped → `dakota-nvidia:stable` never set

**Fix (manual):** Copy from the matching `:testing` digest directly:

```bash
# Confirm revision matches dakota:stable
skopeo inspect docker://ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota:stable \
  | jq '.Labels["org.opencontainers.image.revision"]'
skopeo inspect docker://ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota-nvidia:testing \
  | jq '.Labels["org.opencontainers.image.revision"]'

# Get the testing digest

skopeo copy \
  "docker://ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota-nvidia@${DIGEST}" \
  "docker://ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota-nvidia:stable"
```

**Underlying bug:** `check-diff` should also detect missing variant stable tags
and set `has_diff=true` in that case, forcing the promote job to run even when
the default image hasn't changed.

### Testing branch fast-forward is idempotent — GitHub API 422 on same SHA (2026-06-08)

**Symptom:** `publish.yml` promote job fails with:
```
{"message":"Update is not a fast forward",...}
{"message":"Reference already exists",...}
```
Exit code 1 even though the image was published successfully.

**Root cause:** The original fast-forward step used a PATCH-then-POST fallback:
1. PATCH `refs/heads/testing` → GitHub returns 422 "Update is not a fast forward" when
   the ref is already at the target SHA (no-op case)
2. POST fallback → GitHub returns 422 "Reference already exists"

Both fail, causing the step to fail even though nothing needed updating.

**Fix:** Check the current SHA first; only PATCH or POST when actually needed:
```yaml
CURRENT_SHA=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/git/refs/heads/testing \
  --jq .object.sha 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ "$CURRENT_SHA" = "$BUILD_SHA" ]; then
  echo "testing branch already at $BUILD_SHA — nothing to do"
elif [ -z "$CURRENT_SHA" ]; then
  gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/git/refs --method POST \
    --field ref="refs/heads/testing" --field sha="$BUILD_SHA"
else
  gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/git/refs/heads/testing \
    --method PATCH --field sha="$BUILD_SHA" --field force=false
fi
```

### Merge-queue head_branch is never 'main' — use startsWith guard (2026-06-08)

When a PR merges via GitHub's merge queue, `github.event.workflow_run.head_branch`
(and `needs.setup.outputs.branch`) is `gh-readonly-queue/main/pr-N`, **never** `main`.

Any `if:` condition that checks `branch == 'main'` will silently skip for all
merge-queue merges (i.e., every normal PR merge).

**Correct pattern:**
```yaml
if: >-
  matrix.image_suffix == '' &&
  (needs.setup.outputs.branch == 'main' ||
   startsWith(needs.setup.outputs.branch, 'gh-readonly-queue/main/'))
```

### Direct BST install (pip) for experimental workflows — skip bst2 podman (2026-06-09)

The main `build.yml` workflow runs BST inside the `bst2` podman container (via
`just bst …`). This is the right choice for production builds, but it adds podman
container-launch overhead and introduces a dependency on the `just` wrapper plus
the in-repo `generate-bst-ci-config` action.

For experimental or self-contained workflows (e.g., `sysext-publish.yml`), install
BST directly via pip — the same approach used by `projectbluefin/zirconium-hawaii`.

**Checklist for a direct-BST workflow:**

1. Create `utils/requirements.txt` with pinned BST deps.
2. Install apt packages: `python3-pip python3-venv bubblewrap lzip xz-utils bzip2 gzip git wget curl`
3. Install BST in a venv: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r utils/requirements.txt`
4. Write `~/.config/buildstream.conf` (the standard BST user config — no `--config` flag needed).
5. Enable bubblewrap sandbox: `sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`
6. Run `bst` (not `just bst`) directly with explicit flags: `-o x86_64_v3 true --no-interactive`

**Minimal `~/.config/buildstream.conf` (no remote cache):**
```yaml
scheduler:
  on-error: continue
  fetchers: 32
  builders: 4
  network-retries: 3

logging:
  message-format: '[%{wallclock}][%{elapsed}][%{key}][%{element}] %{action} %{message}'
  error-lines: 80

build:
  retry-failed: True
```

**Do not** pass `CASD_CLIENT_CERT`/`CASD_CLIENT_KEY` if this repo has no credentials
for the projectbluefin cache. The `generate-bst-ci-config` action skips the cache
config block when the vars are empty, but omitting the step entirely is cleaner and
avoids the 5-6x slowdown seen when a push path is active (per zirconium-hawaii's
`reusable-build-bootc.yml`, comment on the "Configure BuildStream to not push"
step).

Artifact checkout (equivalent of `just bst artifact checkout`):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
bst -o x86_64_v3 true --no-interactive \
  artifact checkout "sysext/foo-raw.bst" \
  --directory ".build-sysext/foo-raw"
```

### :next/:btw stream — fully automated, no human gate (2026-06-08)

The `next` branch (`:next`/`:btw` tags) is a continuously rolling GNOME OS
nightly stream. Junction bumps on `next` use auto-merge — no human review
required. This is intentional and differs from core junction bumps on `main`
(which require human review per `track-bst-sources.yml`).

`track-next-junctions.yml` schedules nightly junction tracking on the `next`
branch. PRs it opens get auto-merged once required checks pass.
