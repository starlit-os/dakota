# Dakota Skill Router

Agent entry point. Load only the skill for your current task — do not load everything.

If your first draft says "use dnf/RPM/COPR" or "edit the Containerfile to add a package", stop and reload `docs/skills/not-bluefin.md`. Dakota image changes happen in `.bst` elements and `elements/bluefin/deps.bst`, even though those paths still say `bluefin`.

## Task → Skill

|---|---|
| **Load the dakota build context first** | **⚠️ REQUIRED FIRST — `docs/skills/not-bluefin.md` before any other skill, especially if you have bluefin context. If your plan mentions dnf/RPM/Containerfile overlays, reload it and translate the task into BST terms first.** |
