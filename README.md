**Alpha** — [filing issues](https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota/issues) is the whole point.

## Built-in feedback loop

Dakota doesn't eat tickets, it treats them as evidence.

Every user running Dakota is part of a structured loop that flows directly back into upstream GNOME, freedesktop, and the kernel. When something breaks on your hardware, you have three commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ujust report` | Captures your system state and opens a pre-filled issue. One command instead of a wall of "please attach logs." |
| `ujust confirm <issue>` | Tells the team your hardware hits the same bug. Adds a hardware fingerprint to the issue — no duplicate filing. |
| `ujust verify <issue>` | After a fix ships in a nightly, confirms it works on your machine. Closes the loop with evidence. |

No telemetry. No phone-home. Every report is reviewed by you before it leaves your machine, lives in a gist you own, and can be deleted anytime.

When three users independently run `ujust verify` on a fix, that issue closes with real confidence — not just "we think this is fixed."

### The hardware layer

Each Dakota installation is designed to run as a hardware diagnostic lab for itself. When will you find your first?

## The research behind it

Dakota's feedback loop model is grounded in Andy Anderson's work on autonomous AI-assisted software development. The core finding: the intelligence of a system like this lives not in any single model, but in the infrastructure of instructions, tests, metrics, and feedback loops surrounding it.

## Help shape what gets built

These issues need human judgment before any code is written — design review, domain knowledge, or hardware context the team doesn't have yet:

### [Issues open for discussion &rarr;](https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Astatus%2Fdiscussing)

Leave a comment, push back on the design, or share how your hardware is affected. When a discussion reaches consensus, a maintainer marks it `status/approved` and it enters the contributor queue.

Ready to build something? See the [agent-ready queue](https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aqueue%2Fagent-ready+no%3Aassignee) for issues with clear acceptance criteria and no open questions.

## Known gaps

- Installation path is still being worked on
- Upgrades and rollbacks need more hardening

See the [open issues](https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota/issues) for where things stand.
